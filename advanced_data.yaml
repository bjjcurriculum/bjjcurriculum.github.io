      steps:
        - "They turn to pull your heel up."

        - "Push your foot through and put it on the ground first so the HEEL HOOK GRIP has no torque."
        - "Turn towards your free leg. Go to your bottom knee, face the ground and slightly pull your trapped knee past their knee line."

        - "Sprawl, push away and go PRIDE CHEST to finish the ANKLE LOCK. It is the strongest ANKLE LOCK."
        - "Once you are belly down, if they posture up to their hands and knee and crowd you, keep the ANKLE LOCK GRIP and sit on their trapped thigh with your inside knee and outside foot posting on the ground. Punch your outside fist to their inside hip, step forward and wide your inside leg and you bring your outside knee to the ground to get a BODY LOCK. "

      steps:
        - "K-GUARD or CROSS OUTSIDE ASHI (50/50) -> REAP → BACK SIDE 50/50: 1) Your knees are on the inside. The BACK SIDE 50/50 INSIDE HEEL HOOK has a stronger breaking mechanism. 2) If you do not block their far leg nor their near trapped leg and maintain their trapped knee line above your knee line, and they back step with their outside leg across your torso, they go back to CROSS OUTSIDE ASHI (50/50) and vice versa, hence the name BACK SIDE 50/50. 3) From BACK SIDE 50/50, if they get their knee passed your bottom knee line, you can swivel your knees to the outside to get to the BACK SIDE 50/50 MATRIX and they can sit on your hips and take your back in two ways or get to mount."
        - "IRIMI ASHI or OPEN ASHI or CROSS INSIDE ASHI EARLY DEFENSE → DIAGONAL ASHI: 1) Your knees are on the outside. The DIAGONAL ASHI OUTSIDE HEEL HOOK is not as strong. 2) If you do not block their far leg nor their near trapped leg and maintain their trapped knee line above your knee line, and they back step with their outside leg across your torso, they go back to your CROSS INSIDE ASHI and vice versa. DIAGONAL ASHI can be considered a BACK SIDE CROSS INSIDE ASHI. 3) From DIAGONAL ASHI, if they get their knee passed your bottom knee line, you can swivel your knees to the inside to get the DIAGONAL ASHI MATRIX and they can sit on your hips and take your back in two ways or get to mount."

        - "Your inside foot goes between their legs and your inside shoe lace hooks  behind their hamstring. This way you can slow them down if they try to pull their far away."
        - "Your outside heel and inside knee connect at their hip pocket. Keep that connection solid for better control."
        - "Cover their ankle by default for control and to keep your options open, including IRIMI ASHI GET UP or counter them from getting up."
        - "Use the ANKLE LOCK GRIP only if you need to control their leg, or if you go for an ANKLE LOCK."

        - "The main goal of IRIMI ASHI is to IRIMI ASHI GET UP. If you maintain good hip connection, it is difficult for them to get up, easy for you to get up: IRIMI ASHI GET UP, and easy to attack: ANKLE LOCK. As a leg locker, learn how to get up from any leg entanglement to make them second guess your intentions."
        - "It is difficult for them to attack."
        - "Low probability HEEL HOOK because of the lack of control: they can defend by turning to the inside, go to their knees and pull their trapped leg out."

        - "Lift your thumb up and pull your elbow out to bring their Achille’s to your radius by your wrist (it is shallow, similar to a D’Arce where the radius goes their coronary artery). Your locking hand must always stay by your sternum. Reinforce your locking hand with your secondary arm into a D’ARCE position or with your secondary hand pushing up on your locking hand."

        - "You control the heel and the hip, so that the knee cannot move. Do not pull their heel over to the far side. The tear comes from the fact that as you turn the heel slightly, the knee cannot compensate and the rotation shreds the MCL / ACL / PCL on the INSIDE HEEL HOOK, and the LCL on a OUTSIDE HEEL HOOK. It causes meniscus damage."

        - "Do not get up, or you give them BACK EXPOSURE with one HOOK."
        - "They can get up unless you have an ANKLE LOCK GRIP. If you let go of it, they can pull their heel back to your hip, get up to their knees and get your BACK EXPOSURE."
        - "You need to place both your feet on their hip pocket to bridge off of it (you cannot bridge off the ground) to attack an ANKLE LOCK. Both your feet need to be on their hip pocket. If the outside foot is left outside, it is susceptible to a TOE HOLD."
        - "OUTSIDE HEEL HOOK is available. Hide your feet behind their back. It protects you from HEEL HOOKs but limits your ability to ANKLE LOCK. You cannot have control over their secondary leg because you turn your back from it. And because you let go of the ANKLE LOCK GRIP, they can now get up and get your BACK EXPOSURE. "
        - "Avoid this position unless you want a HEEL HOOK. Even if you attack with a HEEL HOOK, they can still defend by pointing their toes, kicking through and retracting their heel by your hips. They can then take BACK EXPOSURE with one HOOK."

        - "Extend your legs to get both their hands on the ground."
        - "You can also get the UNDERHOOK from STANDING IRIMI ASHI by turning your hips out to create some space for your UNDERHOOK, and then transition to X-GUARD."
        - "X-GUARD push and UNDERHOOK."
        - "UNDERHOOK and X-GUARD push."
        - "UNDERHOOK from STANDING IRIMI ASHI then X-GUARD then push."

        - "Leave your far foot against their near knee crease to prevent them from getting up."
        - "Post the near foot on the ground, raise your hips to make your far leg light and take your far knee to the ground."
        - "Keep your hand on their knee and their shin on your shoulder, or they pull their leg out and  disengage or kick out."
        - "If they re-guard, stand up to face them."
        - "If their secondary leg is close, pull it out with your secondary hand."
        - "You may stand, walk backwards, and sweep their secondary leg to turn them around."
        - "Stand, keep your hand on their knee and their shin on your shoulder, step forward and grab above their knee with your secondary hand (a la SINGLE LEG) to hold onto the band below their knee. Your opposite hand now goes for their hip. Finally climb for double underhooks. Cover their hips."
        - "Underscoop their near leg. Get their shoe lace on your neck."
        - "Extend and retract your legs to get them off balance. Extend your leg to take them down hands to the ground."
        - "TECHNICAL GET UP and rope them in: your opposite hand grabs their ankle, your same side hand under wraps their knee, your opposite hand grabs their near hip and finally your other hand grabs their other hip."

        - "Peel their outside heel off your hip pocket. Sit on the outside of their heel. It forces them to place your inside foot blade on your hip pocket and attack, but the threat of the ankle lock diminishes by half by peeling off their heel, even after they have the ANKLE LOCK in place."
        - "Bring your outside leg in and push off on their chest or grips with it. Once your outside leg is inside, they can no longer finish the ANKLE LOCK."
        - "Do a GRAPPLER’S LIFT to get up and attack."

        - "If they hold your heel or sit on it, blade your inside foot on top of their hip pocket to get some sort of hip immobilization. You can get back to your submission. Do not get up, or you will give them BACK EXPOSURE."
        - "If they go over your foot: #1 - blade your inside foot on top of their hip pocket and get back to your submission, or 2# - leave your inside foot in the inside and IRIMI ASHI GET UP (or #3 - bring both knees inside and catch both ankles for control)."
