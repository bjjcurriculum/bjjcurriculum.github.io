<p>The goal of defensive BJJ is to make you safe and be able to time your escape is Grilled chicken is guard. The other four defensive positions are the safe positions after your guard is passed and your appetite for risk is low. They are played in a dynamic way: you need to transition and escape fast. Never stop. Always move. Move from one to another until you recover your guard or have top position. If your appetite for risk is higher, you can play these positions in a looser way as long as you understand what the gaps are and how to defend them with hand fighting.</p>

                     <li>Lower your head and raise your hands with palms facing inward, using active grips to hand fight (grabbing all four of their fingers).</li>
                     <li>If they secure an underhook, grab their fingers and pummel their hand (or leg) out to reclaim inside position with your elbow.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>

               <ul>
                  <li>The goal of submission grappling is to establish dominance and control over your opponent, particularly in the space between their knees and armpits, to secure a submission.</li>
                  <li>Underhooks offer strong control, while lying flat on your back limits your ability to move athletically. Prevent underhooks and being flat on your back at all costs.</li>
                  <li>Elbows on the ribcage create a gap and elbows in can be further pushed in. Both can be exploited for an underhook. Elbows 2 cm out block underhook access and act as pressure wedges.</li>
                  <li>Defensive elbow and chin position prevents chokes and over unders (seat belts).</li>
                  <li><p>Defensive hands position helps protect your neckline when you feel an arm coming over your shoulder.</li>
