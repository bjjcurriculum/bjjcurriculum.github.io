<p><ul>
<li>Defensive Jiu-Jitsu focuses on positions that slows down upper-body attacks, common in traditional Jiu-Jitsu, to stay safe and time your escape.</li>
<li>Besides Grilled Chicken, which is an optimal supine guard, and Baby Bridge, which is a defensive transition, the four other defensive positions provide safety after your guard is passed.</li>
<li>They are played dynamically. If youâ€™re risk-averse, you can stay compact but must transition quickly; if you are comfortable with more risk, you can play looser but you need to control the gaps through hand fighting.</li>
</ul></p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Always keep elbows in a defensive position.</li>
                     <li>Lower your head and raise your hands with palms facing inward, using active grips to hand fight (grabbing all four of their fingers).</li>
                     <li>If they secure an underhook, grab their fingers and pummel their hand (or leg) out to reclaim inside position with your elbow.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Defensive foot position
                  <ul>

               <ul>
                  <li>The goal of submission grappling is to establish dominance and control over your opponent, particularly in the space between their knees and armpits, to secure a submission.</li>
                  <li>Underhooks offer strong control, while lying flat on your back limits your ability to move athletically. Prevent underhooks and being flat on your back at all costs.</li>
                  <li>Elbows on the ribcage create a gap and elbows in can be further pushed in. Both can be exploited for an underhook. Elbows 2 cm out block underhook access and act as pressure wedges.</li>
                  <li>Defensive elbow and chin position prevents chokes and over unders (seat belts).</li>
                  <li>Defensive hands position helps protect your neckline when you feel an arm coming over your shoulder.</li>
