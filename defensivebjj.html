<p>The goal of defensive BJJ is to make you safe and be able to time your escape is Grilled chicken is guard. The other four defensive positions are the safe positions after your guard is passed and your appetite for risk is low. They are played in a dynamic way: you need to transition and escape fast. Never stop. Always move. Move from one to another until you recover your guard or have top position. If your appetite for risk is higher, you can play these positions in a looser way as long as you understand what the gaps are and how to defend them with hand fighting.</p>p>
